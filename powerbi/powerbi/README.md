# Power BI

Power BI was used only for validation and light visualization of the final dataset.

## Connection
- Data source: SQL Server
- Table: dbo.LifeExpectancy
- Mode: Import

## Visuals
- Line chart:
  - X-axis: Year
  - Y-axis: Life_Expectancy
  - Legend: Entity
- Entity slicer with multi-select enabled

## Purpose
The Power BI report was not designed as a full dashboard.
Its purpose was to:
- Validate the final merged dataset
- Confirm historical continuity
- Compare multiple entities over time

The primary focus of this project is the SQL Server ETL workflow.
